A full-stack project, DevOverflow—a community-driven platform inspired by StackOverflow, enhanced with gamification, recommendations, and more. Using the latest features of Next.js, you’ll explore rendering strategies like SSG, ISR, SSR, PPR, Server Functions, Caching, & Revalidation to create a production-ready application.

The project uses MongoDB for a robust database layer, NextAuth (Auth.js) for versatile authentication options (Email/Password, GitHub, Google), and sleek styling with TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI. DevOverflow enables developers to ask questions, post answers, vote, organize content, contribute, discover jobs, and explore recommended topics—all while engaging with gamified elements like badges and rewards.
